I like to use all my veggies fresh as a personal preference and I try to avoid canned/tinned food, so I used 6 fresh tomatoes(4 Roma tomatoes and 2 Indian tomatoes). In addition to the green chilli, I also used 1/2 tsp. of red chilli powder. I used  3 1/2 cups of water to cook the tomatoes and cauliflower. As for the potatoes, I boiled the cubes of potatoes in water until they were  tender and just had to be stirred into the rest of the curry. I used 2 tsps. of salt in total for this delicious curry.

       "review                [this was a very nice variation on the usual paneer palak that i make using pretty much this method. i followed your recipe exactly, and did include the cream (but of course!:)) thanks for posting - it didn't occur to me to put together something like this till i saw your recipe, and being snowed in and unable to go out to replenish my veggie store, it was a very good recipe to make do with whatever i had at home., This is a wonderful recipe. I made this for dinner tonight. Since my mom is on a diet where she is not allowed to have potatoes, I substituted those with 250 gms. of cottage cheese {paneer}, cut into cubes. I had just 1/2 tsp. of garam masala powder on hand{unbelievable but true!!}, so I added in 1 tsp. of chat masala powder as well to the recipe. While cooking this, I used 2 tbsps. of oil instead of 4. I did not use the cream in this. This tasted extremely yummy and nice. It was just too good for words and yet not heavily laden with fat. We had this with rotis and rice....\n",
